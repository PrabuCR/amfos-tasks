# INTROSPECTION
# Why we must choose you?
I am very much intrested in learnung new things related to computers and i am working on it to get better in it.
I think that this club will help me find out my strengths and weaknesses and make a better one out of me.
I am very much intrested to work with my senior or aluminis or my batchmates and to gain some aknowledge from them so it
will help me to make me better.
